We are big fans of footbal, we wanted to show the progress of the contries on the World Cups.
We scraped the data from the FIFA website and merged with a public DB found on GitHub.

Our project consist of a coded-from-scratch D3 map component with fancy animations and transitions and plenty of interactive/animated charts. Hope you like it ;)
